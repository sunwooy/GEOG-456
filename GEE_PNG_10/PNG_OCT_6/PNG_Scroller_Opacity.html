    Charlotte is one of the fastest growing city in the United States.
    When we compare 2004 and 2019, we see that there is a lot more development. 
    For example, the neighborhood in the lower left expands. In the lower right, 
    we see forests that are cut down to start a bunch of new suburban neighborhoods. We also see
    more bigger buildings which are warehouses, and suppliers (door, automation). 
    Charlotte is a growing city not only for homes but also industry
