    The two year composites show that there is development of housing and industry in the Pineville
    area of Charlotte. This three year composites show a more refined timescale of development. 
    Simply from the two year composite, I assumed that developement of homes occur after industries
    flow in because new homes are needed for new workers. At least in this snapshot it seems 
    as though houses came first before industries. This doesn't necessary mean new homes bring industry
    because this is a small portion of Charlotte. Industry might have developed in other areas of Charlotte
    not captured in the photo and the flux of neighborhood development captured is the result.
