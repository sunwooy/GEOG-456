    <h2>El Niño</h2>
    <p>El Nino is a weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean that last about a year and occurs every two to seven years. During an El Nino event, trade winds weaken and warm water is pushed to the east toward the west coast of the 
        Americas. El Nino is important because it drives weather pattern around the world. In the Americas, the Northern US and Canada are dryer and warmer than usual while the US Gulf Coast and the SouthEast becomes wetter.
        Identifying and tracking El Niño can therefore help communities plan for more intense precipitation or longer droughts along the Americas.

     <p>El Nino is also important because it influence marine life in the Pacific coast. 
        A good case example is Peru. Generally, the west coast of Peru has great productivity and 
        an abundance of fish because of upwelling that brings nutrient rich deep water up to the 
        surface. However, in times of El Nino the thermocline is pushed down causing upwelling of 
        surface ocean water, not the nutrient rich deep water. This means that during an El Nino 
        event fishery in Peru is dried up as productivity decreases. 
        Tracking El Nino and being able to identify instances of El Nino is important to understand 
        how fish patterns will change for fishery. </p>
    <h2>Tracking El Nino</h2>
    <p>One of the best way to track El Nino is to track anomalies in water temperature; 
        these anomalies mean that warm water might be pushed toward the east, 
        raising temperature to levels that it hasn’t been before. </p>
